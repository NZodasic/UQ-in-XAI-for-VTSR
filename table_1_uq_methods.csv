Method,Uncertainty Type,Computational Cost,Ease of Implementation,Accuracy,Best Use Case
Monte Carlo Dropout,Epistemic,Medium (20-30 forward passes),Easy (add dropout at test time),Good,"Model uncertainty, out-of-distribution"
Test-Time Augmentation,Aleatoric,Medium (10-20 augmentations),Easy (apply augmentations),Good,"Data uncertainty, noisy inputs"
Deep Ensembles,Both,High (train multiple models),Medium (train multiple models),Excellent,"Critical applications, highest accuracy"
Bayesian Neural Networks,Both,Very High (approximate inference),Hard (complex inference),Excellent,"Principled uncertainty, research"
Evidential Deep Learning,Both,Low (single forward pass),Medium (custom loss function),Very Good,"Single-pass uncertainty, production"
